## Description<br>

Assignment 4 focuses on implementing Nueral Networks for the task of multi-class classification and regression. <br>

The Jupyter notebook in this repo is the notebook I submitted to be graded. This notebook was a guided application of ML techniques involving extensive prepocessing of the dataset, building, training, testing and optimizing nueral network builds and their learning rates, number of epochs, etc. These nerual networks were applied to electric drive data (multi-class classification)and video game sales data(regression). A significant challenge in building these ML models was overcoming overfitting.<br>

The end results was that I built two models, both neural networks implemented via Tensorflow/Keras modules. One NN was applied to a multi-class classification task involving drive units and the other was a NN applied to a regression task predicting video game sales. <br>
